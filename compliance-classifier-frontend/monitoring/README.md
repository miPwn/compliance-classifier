# Compliance Classifier Frontend - Monitoring System

This directory contains the configuration and implementation files for the comprehensive post-deployment monitoring and feedback collection system for the Compliance Classifier Frontend application.

## Overview

The monitoring system is designed to provide comprehensive visibility into the application's performance, user experience, errors, and user feedback. It consists of five main components:

1. **User Experience Monitoring**: Tracks how users interact with the application
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Measures and optimizes application performance
3. **Error Tracking and Reporting**: Identifies and resolves issues quickly
4. **User Feedback Collection**: Gathers direct input from users
5. **Continuous Improvement Framework**: Uses data to drive ongoing enhancements

## Key Features

### User Experience Monitoring

- **Session Recording**: Records user sessions for playback and analysis
- **Heatmaps**: Visualizes where users click, move, and scroll
- **User Journey Analytics**: Tracks user flows through the application
- **A/B Testing**: Tests different UI variants to optimize user experience

### Performance Monitoring

- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Measures actual user experience metrics
- **Core Web Vitals**: Tracks key performance metrics like LCP, FID, and CLS
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Simulates user interactions to detect issues proactively
- **Performance Alerting**: Notifies when performance degrades

### Error Tracking and Reporting

- **Client-Side Error Tracking**: Captures and reports JavaScript errors
- **Crash Reporting**: Tracks application crashes
- **Error Grouping**: Groups similar errors for easier triage
- **Error Dashboards**: Visualizes error trends and patterns

### User Feedback Collection

- **In-App Feedback**: Collects contextual feedback from users
- **NPS Surveys**: Measures user satisfaction and loyalty
- **Feature Requests**: Gathers ideas for new features
- **Bug Reports**: Allows users to report issues

### Continuous Improvement Framework

- **KPI Tracking**: Monitors key performance indicators
- **Reporting**: Generates regular reports on application performance
- **Prioritization Framework**: Helps prioritize improvements
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporates user feedback into development

## Implementation

See the [Implementation Guide](./ImplementationGuide.md) for detailed instructions on how to implement the monitoring system.

## Monitoring Plan

See the [Post-Deployment Monitoring Plan](./PostDeploymentMonitoringPlan.md) for a comprehensive overview of the monitoring strategy.

## Required Dependencies

The monitoring system requires several third-party services and libraries. See the [package-updates.json](./package-updates.json) file for the required dependencies.

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

The monitoring system integrates with the existing infrastructure:

- **Prometheus**: For metrics collection
- **Grafana**: For visualization and alerting
- **ELK Stack**: For log aggregation and analysis
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: For automated testing and deployment

## Maintenance and Updates

The monitoring system should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure it continues to meet the needs of the application and its users. Key maintenance tasks include:

1. Reviewing and updating monitoring thresholds
2. Adding new metrics as needed
3. Updating synthetic monitoring tests for new features
4. Reviewing and acting on user feedback
5. Updating the continuous improvement framework based on changing business priorities

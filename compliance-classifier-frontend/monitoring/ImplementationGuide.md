## Prerequisites

Before implementing the monitoring system, ensure you have the following:

- Access to the Compliance Classifier Frontend codebase
- Node.js and npm installed
- Angular CLI installed
- Access to the required third-party services:
  - Hotjar or FullStory account
  - Google Analytics 4 account
  - LaunchDarkly or Split.io account
  - New Relic or Datadog account
  - Sentry account
  - Checkly account (for synthetic monitoring)

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies by updating the `package.json` file with the contents from `monitoring/package-updates.json`:

```bash
cd compliance-classifier-frontend
npm install @sentry/angular @sentry/browser @sentry/tracing @sentry/replay web-vitals hotjar-browser fullstory-browser launchdarkly-js-client-sdk split-js-client newrelic-browser datadog-rum datadog-logs
npm install --save-dev @checkly/cli puppeteer lighthouse axe-core
```

2. Create the necessary environment variables in the Angular environment files.

## User Experience Monitoring Implementation

### Session Recording and Heatmaps

1. Create a service for session recording using the configuration from `monitoring/user-experience/session-recording-config.js`.
2. Implement the service with Hotjar initialization code.
3. Add methods for user identification, tagging recordings, and controlling recording behavior.
4. Add the service to the app module.

### User Journey Analytics

1. Create a service for user journey analytics using the configuration from `monitoring/user-experience/user-journey-config.js`.
2. Implement Google Analytics 4 initialization.
3. Add methods for tracking events, journey steps, and journey completion.
4. Add the service to the app module.

### A/B Testing Framework

1. Create a service for A/B testing using the configuration from `monitoring/user-experience/ab-testing-config.js`.
2. Implement LaunchDarkly initialization.
3. Add methods for updating user information, getting variants, and tracking test metrics.
4. Add the service to the app module.

## Performance Monitoring Implementation

### Real User Monitoring (RUM)

1. Create a service for RUM using the configuration from `monitoring/performance/rum-config.js`.
2. Implement New Relic Browser initialization.
3. Add methods for tracking page views, AJAX requests, interactions, and errors.
4. Add the service to the app module.

### Core Web Vitals Monitoring

1. Create a service for Web Vitals using the configuration from `monitoring/performance/web-vitals-config.js`.
2. Implement the web-vitals library to collect Core Web Vitals metrics.
3. Add methods for reporting metrics to analytics and monitoring services.
4. Add the service to the app module.

### Synthetic Monitoring

1. Set up Checkly for synthetic monitoring using the configuration in `monitoring/performance/synthetic-monitoring-config.js`.
2. Create synthetic monitoring checks for critical user flows:
   - Login Flow
   - Document Upload Flow
   - Classification Review Flow
   - Batch Processing Flow
   - Report Generation Flow
3. Configure Checkly to run these checks regularly.

## Error Tracking Implementation

1. Create a service for error tracking using the configuration from `monitoring/error-tracking/sentry-config.js`.
2. Implement Sentry initialization.
3. Add methods for capturing exceptions, setting user context, and adding breadcrumbs.
4. Create an Angular error handler that integrates with Sentry.
5. Add the service to the app module.

## User Feedback Collection Implementation

1. Create a service for feedback collection using the configuration from `monitoring/user-feedback/feedback-config.js`.
2. Implement feedback collection mechanisms:
   - In-app feedback dialog
   - NPS survey
   - Feature request form
   - Bug report form
3. Create PrimeNG components for feedback collection.
4. Add the service to the app module.

## Continuous Improvement Framework Implementation

1. Create a service for the continuous improvement framework using the configuration from `monitoring/continuous-improvement/improvement-framework.js`.
2. Implement KPI tracking and reporting.
3. Create a dashboard for monitoring KPIs and metrics.
4. Implement the prioritization framework for improvements.
5. Set up automated reporting and review processes.

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### Prometheus Integration

1. Configure the frontend to expose metrics for Prometheus scraping.
2. Update the Prometheus configuration to scrape frontend metrics.
3. Create custom metrics for user experience and performance.

### Grafana Dashboard Extensions

1. Create new dashboards for user experience metrics.
2. Extend existing dashboards with frontend performance panels.
3. Set up alerts for critical metrics.

### ELK Stack Integration

1. Configure frontend logging to send to ELK Stack.
2. Create custom Kibana visualizations for frontend logs.
3. Set up alerts for error patterns.

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

1. Add performance testing to CI/CD pipeline.
2. Implement synthetic monitoring checks as deployment gates.
3. Configure error tracking to notify on new errors in releases.

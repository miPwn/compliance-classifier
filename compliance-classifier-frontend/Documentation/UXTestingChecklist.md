# UX Testing Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive manual test plan for layout, mobile scaling, and component behavior in the refactored Angular dashboard using PrimeNG and PrimeFlex.

## Overview

This checklist is designed to ensure that the dashboard provides a consistent, responsive, and intuitive user experience across different devices and screen sizes. It covers layout testing, responsive behavior, component functionality, and accessibility considerations.

## Test Environment Setup

Before beginning testing, ensure you have access to:

1. **Multiple Devices:**
   - Desktop computer (1920×1080 or higher resolution)
   - Laptop (1366×768 resolution)

2. **Multiple Browsers:**
   - Chrome (latest version)
   - Firefox (latest version)
   - Safari (latest version)
   - Edge (latest version)

3. **Developer Tools:**

## Test Reporting

For each test failure:

1. Document the issue with:
   - Test case that failed
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Screenshots or videos
   - Browser/device information
   - Console errors (if any)

2. Categorize the issue:

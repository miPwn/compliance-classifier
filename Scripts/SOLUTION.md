# Compliance Classifier Database Issues - Solution

## Issues Addressed

1. **Missing Tables in PostgreSQL Database**: The comp-filer database had no tables, preventing the application from functioning properly.
2. **Batch Creation Failure**: Users were unable to create batches due to the missing database tables.
3. **Insufficient Error Logging**: The frontend batch creation component didn't provide detailed error information to help diagnose issues.

## Solution Components

### 1. SQL Script for Table Creation

Created `create_database_tables.sql` that:
- Creates all necessary enum types (FileType, DocumentStatus, BatchStatus, etc.)
- Creates all required tables:
  - Users
  - UserPasswords
  - RefreshTokens
  - Batches
  - Documents
  - DocumentMetadata
  - Classifications
  - Reports
- Sets up proper relationships, constraints, and indexes

### 2. Database Testing Scripts

Created two testing scripts:
- `TestDatabaseConnection.cs`: A C# script that verifies database connectivity, table existence, and batch creation
- `RunDatabaseTest.bat`: A Windows batch file that compiles and runs the C# test script
- `setup_database.sh`: A Linux/macOS shell script that creates the database, tables, and verifies everything works

### 3. Frontend Error Logging Improvements

Enhanced the batch creation component (`batch-creation.component.ts`) to:
- Log detailed error information to the browser console
- Provide more specific error messages based on HTTP status codes
- Include additional context about potential causes of errors
- Improve the user experience by showing more helpful error messages

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The database schema follows the domain model with tables for:
- **Batches**: Stores batch information including upload date, user, status, and document counts
- **Documents**: Stores document metadata including file name, type, size, and content
- **Classifications**: Stores classification results including category, risk level, and confidence score
- **Users**: Stores user information for authentication and authorization
- **UserPasswords**: Stores password hashes separately from user data for better security
- **RefreshTokens**: Stores JWT refresh tokens for authentication
- **DocumentMetadata**: Stores additional metadata extracted from documents
- **Reports**: Stores report information for batch and document reports

### Error Handling Improvements

The frontend now handles and logs the following error scenarios:
- Network connectivity issues (status 0)
- Invalid data submissions (status 400)
- Authentication issues (status 401)
- Authorization issues (status 403)
- API endpoint not found (status 404)
- Server errors (status 500)
- Service unavailability (status 503)

For each error type, detailed information is logged to the console, including:
- HTTP status code and text
- Request URL
- Error message and details
- Full error object and stack trace when available

## How to Use

1. Execute the SQL script to create all necessary database tables
2. Run the test scripts to verify the database is set up correctly
3. The frontend batch creation component has been updated with improved error logging

Detailed instructions are available in the `README.md` file.

## Connection Details

The scripts use the following PostgreSQL connection details:
- Host: 192.168.1.106
- Port: 5432
- Database: comp-filer
- Username: vault66admin
- Password: sQ63370

## Next Steps

After implementing this solution:

1. **Verify Frontend Functionality**: Test the batch creation feature in the frontend to ensure it works with the new database tables.

2. **Monitor Error Logs**: Keep an eye on the console logs when users attempt to create batches to catch any additional issues.

3. **Consider Database Migrations**: For future database changes, consider implementing proper Entity Framework Core migrations to manage schema changes more effectively.

4. **Backup Strategy**: Implement a regular backup strategy for the PostgreSQL database to prevent data loss.

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor database performance as data volume grows to ensure the application remains responsive.
